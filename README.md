# Frontier of Gemoetry Computation, 2025 Spring, PKU

The homeworks of the course "Frontier of Geometry Computation" taught by Pengshuai Wang at Peking University in Spring 2025.

- **Homework 1:** the implementation of TSDF Fusion. It provides code architecture which is modified from [tsdf-fusion-python](https://github.com/andyzeng/tsdf-fusion-python).
- **Homework 2:** implement any one mesh processing algorithm, such as mesh simplification, mesh smoothing, parameterization, mesh deformation, etc.
  - I implemented **mesh simplification algorithm based quadric error metrics** using C++.
- **Homework 3:** Reproduce the 3D classification results on ModelNet40 dataset using two papers of your choice. 
  - You can use the open-source code repositories of the papers directly.
- **Homework 4:** Use MLP to reconstruct the surface of 3D shapes from point clouds and SDF values. (Bonus: use Fourier feature postion encoding to improve the reconstruction quality in high-frequency details.)
- **Final Project:** Many topics are available. I choose to implement 3D latent diffusion model for unconditional generation and text conditioning generation.
  - You can refer to the open-source code but it's forbidden to `git clone` the whole repository directly.
  
Interesting course! If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
